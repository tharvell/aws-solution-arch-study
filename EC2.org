* Amazon Machine Images (AMI) 
  An individual AMIs particular to a single region. However, typically all but Private AMIs will be replicated in most regions. 

  - Amazon Quick Start AMIs
  - AWS Marketplace AMIs 
  - Community AMIs  
  - Private AMIs 
** Amazon Quick Start AMIs
   - First images you will seen in the console. 
   - Provided by and officially supported by Amazon. 

** AWS Marketplace AMIs 
   - Official, production-ready images. 
   - provided and supported by industry vendors.
 
** Community AMIs  
   - Created and maintained by independent vendors and individuals. 
   - Usually built to meet a specific need. 
   - Good for pre-build open source stacks on a single machine.  
 
** Private AMIs 
   - Your own instance deployments as private AMIs.
