* Key AWS Terminology 
    - Regions 
    - Availability Zone 
    - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
    - Subnet 
    - Elastic Network Interface (ENI) 
** Region
   - Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area. 
   - Amazon RDS provides you the ability to place resources, such as instances, and data in multiple locations. 
   - Resources aren't replicated across AWS Regions unless you do so specifically.
** Availability Zone (AZ)
   - Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. 
   - Regions will have 3 or more AZs
   - Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. 
** Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
   - provision a logically isolated section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud
** Subnet 
   - After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone.
   - You specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block.
   - Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.
** Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) 
   - A logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.
   - An ENI can be made up of the following components
     + A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
     + One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
     + One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address
     + One public IPv4 address
     + One or more IPv6 addresses
     + One or more security groups
     + A MAC address
     + A source/destination check flag
     + A description

* IP Addresses 
** IPv4
    - 4 Groups of 8 bits  
      + 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000000
    - Which can be represented with integers   
      + 255.255.255.255

** CIDR Notation 
    - It looks like an IP address with a slash suffix : 0.0.0.0/32
    - {{{color(green, routing prefix)}}}  available addresses  {{{color(blue, # of leading bits in subnet mask)}}} 
    - Just for illustration no one uses 'bit' notation    
      + {{{color(green,00000000.00000000.00000000.000000)}}}00{{{color(blue,/30)}}} 
      + Leaves 4 open addresses 
      + 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
      + 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000001
      + 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000010
      + 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000011
    - 10.0.0.0/30  (Example of real notation) 
      + 10.0.0.0
      + 10.0.0.1
      + 10.0.0.2
      + 10.0.0.3


* Firewall Analogs 
 -  Network Access Control List (NACL) 
 -  Security Group (SG) 
** Network Access Control List (NACL) 
** Security Group (SG) 
  - Rules are 'Stateful' 
    + If an inbound request returns a response on another port a steateful

* Internet Gateway
